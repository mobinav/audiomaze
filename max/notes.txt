Did Pilot with Makoto, seem to have worked out all the bugs
Note, the vr plotting seems to do something critical to the maze calculation, which should be fixed
Consider special sound at wall end, wall penetration and edge of world.
Shrink the maze away from room edges
Improve handling of two hands, and when markers drop out.
